General

The Saab Viggen "Thunderbolt" is a multi-role single reactor interceptor. Still modern thanks to major upgrades, it features 
some almost unique specifications. 
In service with the Swedish air force, since 1971 and until after 2006,it was designed to fulfil several roles with one basic airframe, but in multiple versions
Designation code denotes its role: Strike (A), Fighter (J), training (SK) and reconnaissance (SF or SH).

The X-plane 7 model shows the most modern version in active service: the Viggen JA37 Di fighter version 

Like its predecessor the Viggen Di feature the typical delta wing configuration with a canard.

The canard doesn't contribute much lift in itself during normal flight, 
It acts more as a gigantic vortex generator and creates a positive interference with the main wing which induces 
lift and help supersonic cruise.
During low speed flight, canard trailing edge slotted flap can be lowered to increase lift and permit a high nose angle. 
In comparison a blown flap was an alternate solution in the beginning of the project 37.
  
The configuration allows the Viggen to fly at very slow speeds and gives STOL capabilities.
Landing distance is reduced by several means: 
The HUD is used as a precision landing aid, making it possible to aim just 30 m in from the threshold; 
The landing gear thinks a landing sink rate of 5 m/s is normal, so landings are done without any flare; 
The thrust reverser is interconnected with the nose gear link, so it can be selected in the air and will operate when 
the nose is lowered. (It is not intended to be used in the air.) 
However the Viggen D does not use chutes or airbrake to stop.

The aircraft is designed to operate from road strips with relatively short trained conscripts and one technician for 
forward maintenance and turn around. 
Re-fuelling and re-arming by 7 men, of which 6 are conscripts, must take less than 10 min for the JA 37 Viggen.

In order to make the airframe smaller, it was early decided to replace the navigator with a good navigational computer.
This stocky design allows the aircraft to withstand 12 G, but the limit in operation is only 7 G. 
To help pilot to sustain high G level the seat in angled back 19 degrees.

The engine is a US design P&W JT8D-22 built under licence by Volvo, code name RM8, and over boosted with a Swedish designed 
afterburner, reverser, and lots of material changes in the rest.
The power plant can produce 13125 KP thrust with A/B, for the RM8B version, that make the Viggen the world most powerful 
single reactor fighter. 

The aircraft is equipped in standard with a digital flight control system as well as look down shoot down, high ECM 
resistance Doppler radar.
Main weapon is AMRAAM, AIM9, and 30mm oerlikon gun. 
Max payload for the D version is 1.7 metric ton and max range is 2000km.

-Take off

The aircraft was initially designed to operate from narrow 500 m long runways (1640 feet).
The actual take-off run is approximately 400 metres (1310 feet). 
The key points in the aircraft take-off are as follows;
Afterburner is selected then the wheel brakes are released.

The aircraft accelerates to a rotation speed of 135 knots (250 km/h).
About 600 metres of runway are used to get airborne.

After lift-off the undercarriage is retracted and the aircraft accelerates at a 2 to 3 degree climb angle
to 367 knots (680 km/h).
Below 190 knots (350 km/h) the aircraft is very sensitive in roll.
Afterburner is cut out at 270 knots (500 km/h) due primarily to noise abatement requirements.

Exceeding 30 degrees angle of attack results in some loss of yaw stability.
Over 30 degrees AOA the aircraft will enter into a "super stall", but is easily recoverable.
There is little natural pre-stall warning, with low buffet levels.

-Landing
Landing Run: approx 500 m
Landing Speed: 220 km/h
The undercarriage is lowered.
The thrust reverser is pre-selected to activate immediately after landing.
The approach is steep.
The aircraft attitude is 15 degrees nose up.
The speed is controlled by the autopilot.
The aircraft crosses the runway threshold at 130 knots (240 km/h).
Touchdown with a no-flare landing at 97 knots (180 km/h).
Touchdown is about 45 metres (150 feet) beyond the runway threshold.
The undercarriage is designed for a landing sink rate of 16 feet/sec (5 m/s).

**** Operational limitations ****

Minimum airspeed 100 knots
Maximum airspeed M1.1 at MSL, M2+ at FL300. 

Max airspeed gear down and flap: 250 knots

Optimal distance speed: 300 knots

Min speed to max G: 400 knots

Maximum maintainable speed during max turn: 290 knots

Max positive G: 7G
Max negative G: 1G

Max positive G when passing sound barrier (all ATM conditions): 4G (trim shift can cause overload)

Max positive alpha: 23 degrees.

Max net payload: 1.7 Metric tons.

Max speed when reversing max: 130 knots
Min speed when reversing max: 50 knots (shut off thrust reverse in time)

No wheel braking when taxing in reverse. Use engine forward thrust.

Min speed using auto throttle: 150 knots.

Max slow speed bank angle: Not more than 45 degrees below 120 knots to reduce risk of yaw and bank conflict 
in the flight control system (can cause reverse roll).


*************************************************************

**** Emergency procedures ****

In the event of engine failure the system can be operated with reduced authority.
Emergency power is supplied by a ram air turbine just before the left wing leading edge, which extends automatically 
on hydraulic power failure, and just before touch down. 

Ejection is almost inevitable if massive power failure occurs below 1000 feet.

************************************************************



**** Normal procedures ****

** Taxi **

Taxi speed is not more than 40 knots. Use throttle with care.


** Take off **


The aircraft was initially designed to operate from narrow 500 m long runways. 
The actual take-off run is
approximately 400 metres. 
The key points in the aircraft take-off are as follows;

Normal rudder trim (rudder drop 5 degrees or more)
Wheel brake applied
Max thrust
Await A/B ignition
Release wheel brake (It will move! Don't burn the brakes!)
Normal rotation speed is 120 knots (be aware of trim!)

About 500 metres of runway is used to get airborne.
After lift-off the undercarriage is retracted and the aircraft accelerates at a 2 to 3 degree climb angle
to 367 knots.
Below 190 knots the aircraft is very sensitive in roll.
Afterburner is cut out at 270 knots due primarily to noise abatement requirements.
Exceeding 30 degrees angle of attack results in some loss of yaw stability.
Over 30 degrees AOA the aircraft will enter into a "super stall", but is easily recoverable.
There is little natural pre-stall warning, with low buffet levels


** Landing **

The platform is speed instable which means that it will increase alpha as speed slows and thus 
the need for more alpha causes more drag. Be aware of speed at all times (or kiss mother earth for the last time). 
Auto throttle can be used but x-plane A/T is not yet certified for use on the Viggen.

Key points for landing

The undercarriage is lowered.
The thrust reverser is pre-selected to activate immediately after landing.
The approach is steep.
Normal landing alpha: Between 9 and 17 degrees (weight dependent).
The speed is controlled by the autopilot.
Normal landing speed: 126 knots.
Touchdown with a no-flare landing at 97 knots.
Touchdown is about 45 metres beyond the runway threshold.
The undercarriage is designed for a normal landing sink rate of 5 m/s.

Max alpha in touch down: 20 degrees or exhaust will be damaged.

If speed is high, do a few turns as the JA37 does NOT have airbrakes. 
Expect to be able to do braking turns with high control down to 120 knots.


** Normal flight **

Low level: trim the aircraft nose up to reduce probability of controlled flight into ground.
